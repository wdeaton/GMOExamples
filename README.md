# Gmo-Examples

We have discussed the history of GMOs and then the science behind them, lets now talk about GMOs that are out there now. I will also list, and discuss, what they are modified for. First one to discuss will be corn.

- Corn: Field corn has been genetically modified giving it the ability to protect itself from rootworms and the Asian Corn borer. Sweet corn, like field corn, is genetically modified to resist pests more efficiently. 
- Soybeans: GM soybeans are more resistant to pests, diseases, and are more tolerant of herbicides. This allows for less herbicides and a more effect use of the herbicides give. 
- Cotton: Uses less herbicides, due to a higher tolerance, and protects against the cotton ballworm. 
- Alfalfa: Modified for tolerance to herbicides to allow for less pesticide usage. 
- Sugar Beets: GM sugar beets have traits that have virus and pest resistance qualities. Like most crops these beets require less pesticded for weed control. 
- Papya: They are modified to resist the Papaya Ringspot Virus. 
- Squash: These are genetically modified to improve the plants defenses against viruses. 
- Artic Apple: This apple has had the amount of enzymes, that cause the apple to brown, to be reduced thus allowing the apple to brown more slowly when bitten or bruised. 
- Innate Potato: Resists browning and brusises. 

These are some of the GMO crops available today with more in research and testing. Now that we have seen GMO crops, we can now discuss GMO animals. In animals it is harder to distinguish the difference between them being genetically modifed organism(GMO) or just genetically modified(GM). Farmers have been gentically modifying animals for thousands of years and it has become easier today with artificial insemination. 

- Aquabounty Salmon: This new salmon is modified to reach the market size quicker and other farm raised Atlantic salmon. 
- Pig: There is a pig in Canada recently approved that will allow for its feces and urine to have 65% less phosphorus. This is good for lakes, rivers, and streams where excess phosphorus can cause a dead zone. 
- Mosquitos: These mosquitos have gene inserted that will not allow their offspring to reach adulthood. Scientists hope this helps curb the spread of malaria and the Zika virus. 
- Cows: There are cows that can now produce milk compostionly similar to human milk. 
- Chickens: These chickens, still in progress, now have a gene that interrupts the transmission of the avian flu.

There are many more GMOs out there, but I hope this list gives a few examples of what GMOs are out there now.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/wdeaton/GMOExamples/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/wdeaton/GMOExamples/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
